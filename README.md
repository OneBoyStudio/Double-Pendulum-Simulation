# Double-Pendulum-Simulation
This project is an adapted version of my IB extended essay in which I programmed a simulation of a double pendulum and analyzed its chaotic nature via the Lyapunov exponent. The project includes a visual representation of the simulation along with Lyapunov exponent calculator and csv creator.
